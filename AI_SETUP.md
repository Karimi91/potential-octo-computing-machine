# Gemini AI Setup Instructions

## Configuration

The AI service has been successfully set up with the following components:

### 1. Dependencies Installed ‚úÖ
- `@google/genai`: ^1.16.0 (Google Gemini AI client)
- `uuid`: ^11.1.0 (For generating unique session IDs)
- `node-cache`: ^5.1.2 (For caching and session management)

### 2. Environment Variables Added ‚úÖ
The following environment variables have been added to `.env`:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
AI_CONVERSATION_TIMEOUT=1800000
AI_MAX_CONVERSATION_LENGTH=50
AI_RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60
```

### 3. Agricultural AI Service Created ‚úÖ
- Location: `services/aiService.js`
- Model: `gemini-2.0-flash-001` (Latest Gemini model)
- Features: 
  - Agricultural-specific system prompts and expertise
  - Crop recommendation generation
  - Soil and climate analysis integration
  - Connection testing and configuration management
  - Error handling and validation
- Specialized for: Crop recommendations, soil analysis, climate guidance, pest management, sustainable farming practices

## Getting Your Gemini API Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` in `.env` with your actual API key

## Testing the Setup

Run the connection test:
```bash
node test-ai-connection.js
```

Expected output with valid API key:
```
‚úÖ SUCCESS: AI service is properly configured and connected
üìù Test Response: [Gemini AI response]
```

Expected output without valid API key:
```
‚ùå FAILED: AI service connection failed
üìù Error: Gemini API key not configured...
```

## Agricultural AI Features

The AI service includes specialized methods for agricultural applications:

### `generateCropRecommendations(farmingData)`
Generates crop recommendations based on:
- Soil conditions (pH, N-P-K levels, organic matter)
- Climate data (temperature, humidity, rainfall)
- Location and farm size
- Farmer experience level

### `generateAgriculturalContent(userPrompt, context)`
General agricultural guidance with context-aware responses for:
- Pest and disease management
- Irrigation and water management
- Sustainable farming practices
- Market trends and profitability

### Agricultural System Prompt
The AI is pre-configured with expert knowledge in:
- Crop selection and rotation strategies
- Soil analysis and nutrient management
- Weather pattern analysis
- Sustainable and organic farming methods
- Market trends and profitability analysis

## Next Steps

Once you have configured your API key:
1. Run the test to verify connection
2. The AI service is ready for integration with the crop recommendation system
3. Proceed to implement the AI Service Layer (Task 2)

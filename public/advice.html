        <ol>
            <li>Alluvial Soil: Found near rivers and is fertile due to its rich mineral content. It's commonly used for crops like rice, wheat, and sugarcane.</li>
            <li>Black Soil: Also known as Regur soil, it is known for its high fertility and moisture retention capacity. It's suitable for cotton, cereals, and oilseeds.</li>
            <li>Red & Yellow Soil: These soils are well-drained and moderately fertile. They are suitable for crops like millets, pulses, and groundnuts.</li>
            <li>Laterite Soil: Found in tropical regions, these soils are rich in iron and aluminium. They are suitable for crops like cashew, tea, coffee, and rubber.</li>
            <li>Loamy Soil: A mix of sand, silt, and clay, it has good fertility and drainage. It supports a wide range of crops, including vegetables, fruits, and cereals.</li>
            <li>Sandy Soils: These soils drain quickly and are less fertile but are suitable for crops like peanuts, maize, and potatoes with proper irrigation.</li>
            <li>Black Cotton Soils: These are clayey soils that swell when wet and shrink when dry. They are good for cotton cultivation but require careful management.</li>
